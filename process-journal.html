                <p>In the location, we surveyed 100 users through questionnaires and found the most popular locations, namely hospitals, streets, airports, and attractions. The percentages were 35%, 37%, 51%, and 62% respectively.</p>

                <p>The sights are really attractive when I first thought about it. We all want to let the tour relax our mood. If you have a scooter, it will definitely make our journey more enjoyable.
Even if many users choose the scenic spot, there are still many problems in implementing the unmanned mobility scooter in the scenic spot. There are many real problems that we have not considered. There are a series of problems when the openness of the attractions is limited. For example, there may be road congestion, damage to ancient buildings, and encounter stairs. The solution I thought of at the time was that it was only for a small number of elderly and disabled people.
After our group discussion of the second assessment , we found that although the attraction can supply a small number of people , the risk factor is still high , and the function of software development is also less .Since the achievability of the attraction project is very small, we gave up on this idea.

            </h6>
                <p>In the initial stage, I think the airport is a very suitable place for unmanned mobility scooters. Because the airport terrain is empty and flat, users always take some luggage. At this time, I think we need a scooter to help us alleviate our burden. Help us take some luggage. Even if we need to walk through the long terminal, don't be too tired, because we have a scooter that can replace our walk.
We even made some sketches about the airport, such as taking a ticket to pick up the unmanned mobility scooters, etc., just when we thought about how to use the scooter to check the baggage and pass the security check, we have some problems, such as how to use the scooter to checked baggage when you use a scooter, do you want to use it? If you use a scooter to queue up, it will cause road congestion. If you only use the scooter to transport the baggage, it will cause loss. Another type of safety check will cause the car to change. We originally wanted to use the scooter to provide convenience to people, but in these respects, the scooter seems to be no longer convenient.

                            <p>In the initial planning, I saw the existing design, shared the bicycle, and began to imagine that we can let the unmanned scooter also share, which may provide convenience for people, but when doing the interview, many users said that it is convenient. But it may cause road congestion and is less secure. In terms of dealing with this, we think it might be possible to make the user less, for example, only for the elderly or disabled.</p>

                            <p>We think the hospital may be more appropriate because many of the users here are not free to move. If you only want to take a wheelchair, wheelchairs are not convenient in many situations. You may need the power of others to move. This reflects this. The importance of driverless mobility scooter is that the hospital is very busy at some point, so it is very unsuitable for relatively large scooters. In this regard, it remains to be verified.</p>

In the street area, I proposed a sharing plan (taking the existing design sharing bicycle as an example, I want users to also use shared unmanned mobility scooters.), but the negative impact will be a lot, so I gave up the idea, and finally we decided to we decided to focus on the streets and hospitals.</p>

                <p>After the background investigation, we thought of its expansion, the scooter software - the software installed in the scooter tablet. A software that better protects the applicable population (elderly), including control speed, maps, health management, clinics, etc.
When using a mobility scooter, we can't automate the first step with just the button. We hope that the scooter is more convenient and more practical, because our main audience is the elderly people, so we designed a software for the elderly to give it some special features, such as helping users measure heartbeat blood pressure and statistical walking steps, and can send it to doctors and family members at any time. Sometimes older people may not be able to see the things clearly, so a voice service is established.
In many cases, elderly are not good at using mobile phones, so the family often does not know the location of the elderly. We can use the scooter software to turn on the positioning settings so that the family can know the location of the old man at any time.

                <p>According to the feedback from users, we can find that there are many functions that we can expand. For example, we can improve some functions on our software, such as calendar function and drug reminder. The function of medicine used every day can also be Existing functional health management and clinic connections. Enhance some of the features in the map like positioning systems and sending your location to your family. There are many users who own a unmanned car at home. Maybe we can connect the unmanned mobility scooter to the car at home.

We can develop some features in the software to reduce the user's concerns, such as the map positioning system, and the security measures that can be adjusted at any time or in the event of excessive heart rate or other conditions.

In Campbell’s(2016) research said generally application’s designs for elderly avoid font sizes smaller than 16 pixels. Printable content is super useful for people with vision and perception problems. So in our software all use more than 16px text

            </h5>
            <P>There is no text reminder in the main sidebar, and the overall is not very beautiful, we think that if the main sidebar may not be useful in the home page, according to the user feedback, we add the emergency button and the button to adjust the speed.
In the top column, there is still time and temperature reminder, and the original adjusting text size will be changed.
Every icon may be changed, because the icon may be larger but it looks crowded. It may change the distance between the icons.

            <P>Mainly old people, some students with design background and designers. We could easily find in Wilkinson building while they gave many suggestions about the visual style and typesetting. Invision was used in the test, the user seat in a chair pretends an old person riding AMS.</P>

            </h5>
            <P>On most pages we use the 2d style, but we use the 3d style on some important buttons, there are many users suggest us that we should use the faded color to reduce the awkwardness.

We designed the “help” button with a gradient color to make it obvious for user, so we changed it with a darker color, but it is still a gradient color. The big "back" key affects the overall aesthetics so we use smaller one.

            <P>After the test, only "very healthy" is displayed on the left side of the screen, and the left layout is very monotonous. Which makes the entire page looking inharmonious.

We both agreed this opinion, so we change the layout of the page and added an emoji under “very healthy”.

                <p>Using too many different colors. Our original intention is to let the elderly people get visual reminders through the color, but too many colors have caused visual clutter, we should probably think about it how to solve this problem.
